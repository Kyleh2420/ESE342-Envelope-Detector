\section{Assignment}

Design an envelope detector for demodulating an amplitude modulated signal arriving at the reciever. The signal arriving at the input of the demodulator is given by 

\begin{equation}
    v_c(t) = 5.0[1+\mu x(t)]cos(2\pi f_ct+\phi_0) \ \ \ \mu V
\end{equation}

where the modulation index, $\mu$ = 0.3, $\phi$\textsubscript{0} is an arbitrary phase angle and f\textsubscript{c} = 98.6 MHz is the carrier frequency. Generate a music signal x(t) for testing and verification of your envelope detector.

You must model the various electrical components, such as the diode, and process the signal in the time domain. You should display the signal at various stages of processing. Input should be taken from a music file and the output file should be played using any audio player.
