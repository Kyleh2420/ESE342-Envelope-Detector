\section{Introduction}

This report will lay out the design and construction of an Envelope Detector of an amplitude modulated signal. Deviating from the assignment, we will not be using 98.6 MHz as our carrier frequency due to the computational complexity required. 

This design assumes common positive power rails are available, such as 5V. This design also assumes standard X7R capacitors and standard resistors, according to the E24 standard.

Specific to the MATLAB code, it can take in a file of any number of channels. However, it will only output an audio file with 1 audio channel. Additionally, we have amplified the audio signal before modulating and interpolated samples of the audio file to respect the analog world.
