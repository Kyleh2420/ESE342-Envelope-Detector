# ESE342-Envelope-Detector
A Project for Stony Brook University's ESE 342: Communication Systems. We created an Envelope Detector!

This is an Amplitude Demodualtor that I created with Johnny Liu. Here, we simulated the hardware required to decode an AM signal, such as the one that you might recieve over the radio. To simulate reality, we modeled the mathmatical functions based on readily available components, such as standard diodes, resistors, and capacitors.
